# Contributing to envigor

## Adding a service

Feel free to submit patches to add any service / interface you know well enough
to configure. Before doing so, try to get a feel for how things tend to be
laid out by looking over the rest of the documentation and code.

## Adding tests

Right now, envigor is kind of scant on tests, so feel free to add any tests
you feel are justified. Particularly, add any tests for issues that you
discover and/or fix.
